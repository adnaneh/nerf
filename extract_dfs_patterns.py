1. INSTRUMENT THE DFS FUNCTION:
   Add logging to track every choice made during successful solutions:
   - Round number
   - Position in state (0-31)
   - Output value requiring choice
   - Which choice was made (0 or 1)
   - Whether this path led to success

2. RUN MULTIPLE SOLUTIONS:
   Execute hireme2 1000+ times to collect diverse solution paths

3. ANALYZE SUCCESS PATTERNS:
   - Which choice index (0 or 1) is selected more often for each output?
   - Do certain bit patterns correlate with success?
   - Are there round-dependent preferences?
   - Do choices early in the process affect later success rates?

4. BUILD STATISTICAL MODEL:
   Create a scoring function: P(success | choice, context)
   Where context includes:
   - Current round
   - Position in state
   - Neighboring choices
   - Remaining constraints

5. VALIDATE THE MODEL:
   Test the heuristic against random choice to measure improvement
